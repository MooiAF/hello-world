        <h1>WHO I AM</h1>

        <div>I go by the name of Mooi Pheto and i am a really calm lad hailing
        all the way from south africa. By height i am 6'2 tall and weigh about 80kg
        because i do not like keeping track of my weight. I speak and understand 8 languages
        and keen to learn more. I do not usually stand out however i do great as a team player
        because i am of the belief that team work makes the dream work, you can quote me on that
        one.

        My educational background has no programming in it. I studied for an Education Degree which
        i unfortunately could not finish due to financial circumstances. However i fell in love with
        programming, something i wish i knew i loved before making all the bad choices. My dream is
        to grow in this field and not only make it a career but use it to give my country a better
        future.
